## Prepare In Advance
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) or [K3D](https://k3d.io/v5.5.2) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.

Tips: 
- Recommended to use k3d to quickly build k8s cluster (https://github.com/yueyueaa/k8s-setup/blob/master/k3d/README.md) `bash k3d.sh`
- If you want to use webhook, you need install cert-manager to your cluster (https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation)

## Getting Started
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/yueyuea:tag
```

Tips: 
- If you use `bash k3d.sh` create cluster, your registry is `localhost:5000`
- If you can't use `make docker-build` or `make docker-push`, you can try `make ko-image` to quickly build image (https://ko.build/)

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/yueyuea:tag
```

Tips:
- To make it easier to package and deploy controller/operator to the cluster, you can use `make all`, then you can apply yaml to cluster

### Uninstall CRDs Or Undeploy controller 
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall  # delete the CRDs from the cluster
make undeploy   # delete the controller from the cluster
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.
